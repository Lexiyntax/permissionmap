# Permission Mapper
This is a sandbox for playing around with parsing and permission handling for a fictional four element permission mapping system.

Currently three mapping types are implemented:
* simple 'loop' map type taking a brute force approach
* caching map type which takes the loop approach and wraps it with a cache
* tree map type, which tokenizes the permission array into a tree then uses that for lookups

## Building
```
mvn clean build
```

## Running
```
java -jar target/permissionmap-<version>.jar
```

## TODO
* Unit testing, especially hammer on more corner cases
* Optimizations with type finalization and membership
* Add more fun dynamically generated data sets to test with
* PermTester has a bunch of lazy duplication
* Test caching at different levels in the tree mapper so it spends less time on tree generation
* Optimize cache lookup to reduce string comparison load
